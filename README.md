# LaTeX Template Poem

Unlike academic templates for large papers and publications, this repo serves as a quick-start for crafting beautifully formatted poetry. Featuring a stylized title and environments for both single and double column poems, this template is a great way to quickly organize poetry into a presentable and pleasing PDF document.

Please start by replacing this README file with a description of your project and specify the filename of your LaTeX document in the Makefile. By default, the Makefile will first run `pdflatex` to render your document and will utilize `bibtex` to process the project bibliography and then it will delete any intermediate auxiliary or log files. Additional targets exist to give developers more granular control of the rendering and cleaning processes.
