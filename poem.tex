\section{Horatius~\cite{maculay-lays}}
\label{sec:horatius}


\begin{doublepoem}
	\begin{altverse}\xstanza
	Then out spake brave Horatius,	\\
	The Captain of the Gate:		\\
	To every man upon this earth	\\
	Death cometh soon or late.		\\!
	\end{altverse}

	\begin{altverse}\xstanza
	And how can man die better		\\
	Than facing fearful odds,		\\
	For the ashes of his fathers	\\
	And the temples of his gods?	\\!
	\end{altverse}
\end{doublepoem}

\section{Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven~\cite{yeats-aedh}}
\label{sec:aedh}


\begin{singlepoem}
	\begin{altverse}\xstanza
	Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,			\\
	Enwrought with golden and silver light,			\\
	The blue and the dim and the dark cloths		\\
	Of night and light and the half light,			\\
	I would spread the cloths under your feet:		\\
	But I, being poor, have only my dreams;			\\
	I have spread my dreams under your feet;		\\
	Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.	\\!
	\end{altverse}
\end{singlepoem}
